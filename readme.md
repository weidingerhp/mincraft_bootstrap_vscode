## Simple Bootstrap Bukkit-Minecraft for VSCode

This should enable everyone to write Craft-Bukkit Plugins with the VS-Code IDE. I personally like this IDE for small things because it
 - is fast
 - is multilingual
 - is not bound to any language
 - Code-Assist does work (at least for me :) )
 - its free
 - its multi-plattform
 - its properly maintained

 Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

to use this correctly you will need to add
 - Gradle Language Support
 - JAva Extension Pack
 - Language support for Java
 - Java Test runner (if you plan to do test - which you should)
 - Maven for Java

 
 What to do:

 Clone this repo and delete the .git directory in you main folder (so you dont accidentially check something into the wrong directory)
 Open the folder with VS-Code.

 Ready ... Set ... Go ....
